# Contributing to zk-HumanProof Protocol

Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to the **zk-HumanProof Protocol**! This project aims to create a privacy-preserving, browser-native method for verifying human users using zero-knowledge proofs. All ideas, suggestions, and contributions are welcome.

## How to Contribute

### üîç Propose Ideas or Improvements

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/Your-Name-Here/zk-humanproof-protocol/issues) for feedback, questions, or feature ideas.
- Use the `enhancement` or `spec-discussion` labels to help organize the discussion.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Edit the Specification

- Changes to the spec (e.g., `README.md` or the core spec file) should be focused and well-documented.
- Include a brief rationale for why your change improves clarity, utility, or flexibility.

### üß™ Add Examples or Reference Code

We welcome:
- Verifier circuits (e.g., using Circom, Noir, or Halo2)
- Sample `crawler.txt` implementations
- Browser API mockups or simulations
- Middleware or backend validation examples

Please place contributions under the `/examples/` directory with a short README in each subfolder.

### üõ† Build Supporting Tools

If you‚Äôre working on:
- A prover module (browser/client-side)
- Middleware or proxy validation tools
- Browser API polyfills or proposals

Let us know and open a tracking issue. We‚Äôd love to collaborate.

## Style and Structure

- Prioritize privacy, modularity, and browser-friendliness.
- Keep specification changes concise and understandable.
- Proposals for new sections or extensions (like `crawler.txt`) are welcome‚Äîopen an issue or draft a PR.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a respectful, constructive code of conduct. Disagreements are fine‚Äîhostility is not.
